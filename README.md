# Recipe App Hooks and ContextAPI
Project developed in ReactJS with Hooks, ContextAPI and TailwindCSS.

## Why does this exist?
- This project was developed as an end of module project at Trybe School.
- The main goal was to train our skills in ReactJS, work with functional components, ContextAPI and Hooks.

### Main concepts used in this project were:
- Divide every function, functionality or element into components to better arrange and segment the code.
- Main usage of "global states" using Context as a main state manager, transform local states into global ones.
- Use of CSS frameworks to help the development and improve the appealingness, in this case I've used TailwindCSS.
- Develop your logic into a ```src/assets/helpers``` folder and ```src/assets/services```.
- Name all folders and files in __```kebab-case```__, JSX components in __```PascalCase```__ and JS functions in __```cammelCase```__.
